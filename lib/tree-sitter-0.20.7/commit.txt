Tree sitter 0.20.7

https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/releases/tag/v0.20.7

All the non-library stuff has been removed to save space. The generator tool
itself uses Rust, so it's not built as part of the build process.

The web and rust runtime library bindings were also removed, since we only
need the C implementation.

This is purely needed for the IDE support: the compiler itself uses a modified
version of upstream Wren's parser.
